## üîÑ Release Workflow

### 1. Pre-Release Planning

#### Feature Freeze (Minor/Major Releases)
```bash
# 1. Announce feature freeze on develop branch
# 2. Create milestone for release
# 3. Triage remaining issues
# 4. Update project board
```

#### Release Preparation Checklist
- [ ] All planned features merged to `develop`
- [ ] All tests passing on `develop`
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks run
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md prepared
- [ ] Version number decided

### 2. Release Branch Creation

#### Using Release Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Ensure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop

# Create minor release (auto-increment version)
uv run python scripts/release.py --type minor

# Or create specific version
uv run python scripts/release.py 1.2.0

# For hotfix from main
uv run python scripts/release.py --hotfix --type patch

# Dry run to preview changes
uv run python scripts/release.py --type minor --dry-run
```

#### Manual Process
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version in pyproject.toml
# Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.0"

# Push release branch
git push origin release/v1.2.0
```

### 3. Release Candidate Testing

#### Automated Testing
- Full test suite execution
- Integration tests
- Security scans
- Performance benchmarks
- Docker image build and test

#### Manual Testing
- [ ] Installation from source
- [ ] Basic functionality verification
- [ ] Example scripts execution
- [ ] Documentation accuracy
- [ ] Breaking change verification (if any)

#### Release Candidate Builds
```bash
# CI/CD automatically builds:
# - Docker images tagged as v1.2.0-rc.1
# - Python packages (not published to PyPI)
# - Documentation preview
```

### 4. Release Finalization - AUTOMATED

#### Create Release PR
```bash
# Create PR from release/v1.2.0 to main
gh pr create --base main --head release/v1.2.0 --title "Release v1.2.0"
```

#### PR Review Process
- [ ] Code review by maintainers
- [ ] Final testing verification
- [ ] Release notes review
- [ ] Breaking changes documentation
- [ ] Migration guide (if needed)

#### Merge PR - Automatic Finalization! ü§ñ
```bash
# After PR merge, automatically happens:
# ‚úÖ Create tag v1.2.0
# ‚úÖ Publish to PyPI
# ‚úÖ Publish Docker images
# ‚úÖ Create GitHub Release
# ‚úÖ Merge main back to develop
# ‚úÖ Cleanup release branch

# NO NEED to run finalize_release.py manually anymore!
```

#### Fallback: Manual Finalization
```bash
# If automation fails:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py --version 1.2.0
```

### 5. Automated Publication

#### Triggered by Tag Creation
The CI/CD pipeline automatically:
1. **Builds final artifacts**:
   - Python wheel and source distribution
   - Docker images for multiple architectures
   - Documentation

2. **Publishes to registries**:
   - PyPI (Python Package Index)
   - GitHub Container Registry (Docker images)
   - GitHub Releases (artifacts and release notes)

3. **Updates documentation**:
   - Deploys latest docs
   - Updates version references

### 6. Post-Release Tasks - AUTOMATED

#### Automatic Tasks (executed automatically)
```bash
# ‚úÖ Merge main back to develop (automatic)
# ‚úÖ Delete release branch (automatic)
# ‚úÖ Create GitHub Release (automatic)
# ‚úÖ Publish artifacts (automatic)
```

#### Manual Tasks
```bash
# Monitor automatic finalization
gh run list --repo dmitryanchikov/mcp-optimizer --workflow="Auto-Finalize Release"

# Check publication
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/mcp-optimizer/json | jq '.info.version'
```

#### Communication
- [ ] Announce release on GitHub Discussions
- [ ] Update project README if needed
- [ ] Notify community channels
- [ ] Update dependent projects

#### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor PyPI download stats
- [ ] Check for immediate bug reports
- [ ] Monitor Docker image pulls
- [ ] Review user feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Release Scripts and Automation

### Release Scripts
The project includes automated scripts for managing releases:

#### `scripts/release.py` - Create Release Branches
Automates creation of release or hotfix branches with proper version management.

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Create minor release (auto-increment from current version)
uv run python scripts/release.py --type minor

# Create specific version
uv run python scripts/release.py 1.2.0

# Create hotfix from main
uv run python scripts/release.py --hotfix --type patch

# Preview changes (dry run)
uv run python scripts/release.py --type minor --dry-run

# Skip tests (emergency use only)
uv run python scripts/release.py --skip-tests
```

#### `scripts/finalize_release.py` - Finalize Releases (AUTOMATED!)
Creates release tags and handles post-release cleanup. **Now runs automatically after PR merge!**

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Auto-detect version (recommended)
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py

# Specific version
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py --version 1.2.0

# Skip CI check (if confident CI passed)
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py --skip-ci-check

# Keep release branch (don't cleanup)
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py --skip-cleanup

# Preview only
uv run python scripts/finalize_release.py --dry-run
```

### Script Features
- **Version Management**: Auto-increment or manual version specification
- **Branch Validation**: Ensures correct source branch (develop/main)
- **Test Integration**: Runs full test suite before release
- **Git Flow Compliance**: Follows proper branching strategy
- **CI/CD Integration**: Triggers automated builds and publishing
- **Safety Checks**: Git working directory validation, version format validation

### Required Tools
